Normally only several micrometers in length, bacteria assume the form of spheres, rods, spirals and other shapes. Bacteria are found in a very broad gamut of habitats; for example, bacterial extremophiles that thrive in such places as hot springs, arctic environments, radioactive waste, deep sea oil seeps, deep Earth crustal environments, hypersaline ponds and within other living organisms. There are approximately 50 million bacterial organisms in a single gram of typical surface soil. The worldwide bacterial biomass exceeds that of all plants and animals on Earth. However, the majority of bacteria have not yet been characterised.'

The Amoebozoa also include the slime moulds, multinucleate or multicellular forms that produce spores and are usually visible to the unaided eye. Amoebozoa vary greatly in size. Many are only 10-20 micrometers in size, but they also include many of the larger protozoa. The famous species Amoeba proteus may reach 800 micrometers in length, and partly on account of its size is often studied as a representative cell. Multinucleate amoebae like Chaos and Pelomyxa may be several millimetres in length, and some slime moulds cover several square feet.'

Most cryptomonads are photosynthetic (and are thus referred to as cryptophytes) and possess plastids that are very diverse in pigmentation (Figure 1). In addition to being important from an ecological perspective, the cryptophytes are of pivotal significance in terms of our understanding of endosymbiosis and the evolution of plastids. This is because cryptophytes acquired photosynthesis by the process of secondary (i.e., eukaryote-eukaryote) endosymbiosis, having engulfed and assimilated a red algal endosymbiont at some time during their evolutionary past (Archibald and Keeling 2002; Bhattacharya et al. 2003; Gould et al. 2008). As a result, cryptophytes are extremely complex from a genetic and cell biological perspective, having a four-membrane-bound plastid and four distinct DNA-containing cellular compartments, the plastid, mitochondrion, host nucleus and endosymbiont nucleus, the latter being referred to as the nucleomorph. The cryptophyte nucleomorph genome is highly reduced in structure and coding capacity, and is the focus of ongoing research aimed at understanding the pattern and process of secondary endosymbiosis (Gilson and McFadden 2002; Archibald 2007).'

The presence of both phagotrophic and photautotrophic species within the same group has led to redundant classification schemes under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature and the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (so-called "ambiregnal taxa"). Euglenids are neither plant nor animal, so the group does not fall neatly within the archaic plant-animal dichotomy that still pervades biological thinking. Approximately 1,400 species of euglenids have been described so far, and it is possible that at least twice that many await discovery. The amount of morphological and behavioral diversity present in this group is exceptionally high (e.g. see title illustrations and Fig. 1) and provides compelling evidence for major events in eukaryote evolution, such as the punctuated effects of secondary endosymbiosis and mutations in underlying developmental mechanisms (Leander et al. 2007). Several photosynthetic and osmotrophic species are bloom-formers in nutrient-rich conditions and are useful indicators of environmental pollution. Phagotrophic species (i.e. bacterivores and eukaryovores) are ubiquitous primary consumers and are important components of microbial food webs across the globe. Knowledge of euglenids extends back to the invention of the first microscope in the late 1600"s by Leeuwenhoek, and a few of these species have subsequently been used as model systems for addressing a wide variety of questions in basic cell biology. Euglena gracilis, for instance, is familiar to nearly every student who has ever taken a general biology course in high school, college or university.'

Fornicates are unicellular heterotrophic flagellates with one or two karyomastigonts per cell. One karyomastigont bears one to four flagella. Fornicates exhibit several unusual characteristics, notably absence of classical mitochondria. Therefore, they were once considered to represent basal, primarily amitochondriate eukaryotes, so-called "Archezoa". However, it has been shown that the presumably primitive fornicate cell arose rather by simplification and that Fornicata possess reduced mitochondria-related organelles. The clade consists of four disparate lineages: free-living Carpediemonas and Dysnectes, both free-living and parasitic diplomonads (Diplomonadida), and almost exclusively parasitic retortamonads (Retortamonadida). Diplomonads, the best known fornicate group, comprise several important parasitic species including the human intestinal pathogen Giardia intestinalis. Interestingly, most diplomonads are diplozoic, i.e. their cells possess two identical and axially symmetrical sets of all cellular structures, though the symmetry is probably only superficial. Some diplomonads also use an alternative genetic code. The other fornicates, i.e. retortamonads, Carpediemonas and Dysnectes, are among the least studied eukaryotes.'

The close relationship of the multicellular taxa was initially indicated by molecular means. The group contains uniflagellated solitary and colonial protists with one flagellum at some stage in their life history, phagotrophs, saprophytes, mycelial organisms with spore-forming bodies but no flagella, multicellular heterotrophs formed from layers of cells (epithelia), and the sponges with a less structured arrangement of cells. Collagen, one of the components of the extracellular matrix of the animals has also been reported from some fungi. All of the flagellated taxa and flagellated cells swim with a single flagellum beating behind the cell. The term opisthokonta has been applied to this grouping (Cavalier-Smith and Chao 1995; Cavalier-Smith 1996). However, Cavalier-Smith and Chao do not use the term as a formal taxon because it would require that more important taxa are subordinated to less important taxa. Here, the opisthokonts is a taxon with the composition as indicated. The name may need to be revisited as the term Opisthokonta has previously been used by Copeland (1956) for the chytrids. Some other permanently or temporarily opisthokont protists-such as several nominal pelobionts or the unassigned Phalansterium or Pseudaphelidium-are not included, and it is not yet known if they form part of this group. Ultrastructural identity: The diversity of organization within this group is great, extending from uniflagellated protists with or without the ability to make siliceous products to multicellular myeelial or epitheliate organisms. Apart from having platycristate mitochondria and being dictyosomate, this group has few discriminating characters that extend throughout this group. Nuclear division is variable within the fungi but in the animals, the envelope breaks down during mitosis. Synapomorphy: Unspecified but probably may relate to the radiating and arcing anchorage structures associated with the single flagellum. Very few studies of the protistan (ancestral) members have been conducted, and until more detailed ultrastructural studies are carried Out, such a determination would probably be premature. Most included taxa have secondarily lost this character. Composition: The largest of the major eukaryote lineages with probably in excess of 1,000,000 species, in two major clusters: (chytrids + true fungi) + (choanoflagellates + Metazoa). These two clusters themselves require appropriately defined names. This taxon includes the Myxospora (previously thought of as a group of protozoa) as a subset of the Cnidaria; and the Microspora are placed with the fungi in line with recent molecular evidence.'

They are believed to be the sister group to the animals (kingdom Animalia). As their name implies, choanoflagellates (collared flagellates) have a distinctive cell morphology characterized by an ovoid or spherical cell body 3-10 micrometers in diameter with a single apical flagellum surrounded by a collar of 30-40 microvilli. Movement of the flagellum creates water currents that can propel free-swimming choanoflagellates through the water column and trap bacteria and detritus against the collar of microvilli where these foodstuffs are engulfed (see this animation from the University of Alberta). Dujardin, a French biologist interested in protozoan evolution, noted the morphological similarities of choanoflagellates and sponge choanocytes and proposed the possibility of a close relationship as early as 1841 (Leadbeater and Kelly 2001). Over the past decade, this hypothesized relationship between choanoflagellates and animals has been supported by independent analyses of multiple unlinked sequences: 18S rDNA, nuclear protein-coding genes, and mitochondrial genomes (Wainright et al. 1993; Mendoza et al. 2002; Burger et al. 2003; Ruiz-Trillo et al. 2004, 2006; Steenkamp et al. 2006). Importantly, comparisons of mitochondrial genome sequences from a choanoflagellate and three sponges confirm the placement of choanoflagellates as an outgroup to Metazoa and negate the possibility that choanoflagellates evolved from metazoans (Lavrov et al. 2005). Finally, recent studies of genes expressed in choanoflagellates have revealed that choanoflagellates synthesize homologues of metazoan cell signaling and adhesion genes (King et al. 2003). Because choanoflagellates and metazoans are closely related, comparisons between the two groups promise to provide insights into the biology of their last common ancestor and the earliest events in metazoan evolution. Choanoflagellates are found globally in marine, brackish and freshwater environments from the Arctic to the tropics, occupying both pelagic and benthic zones. Although most sampling of choanoflagellates has occurred between 0 m and 25 m, they have been recovered from as deep as 300 m in open water (Thomsen 1982) and 100 m under Antarctic ice sheets (Buck and Garrison 1988). Many species are hypothesized to be cosmopolitan on a global scale,  while other species are reported to have restricted regional distributions (Thomsen et al. 1991).'

                  desc: 'The term fungus has more than one meaning. It is best limited to members of the kingdom Fungi - in which the normal trophic form is a system of filaments or mycelia and from which spores are occasionally produced. Feeding usually occurs through the mycelia, and the spores usually facilitate distribution and help the fungus colonize new habitats. The true fungi have their evolutionary origins within the chytrids (some taxonomists include these within the fungi). In addition to the true fungi, a number of other evolutionary lineages have produced fungus-like organisms. The most similar are the oomycetes, a lineage that is related to diatoms and brown algae - all being members of the stramenopiles. Other fungus-like organisms include amoeboid slime moulds. The true fungi are heterotrophic organisms. The cytoplasm is enclosed within a chitinous cell wall. While the majority of species grow as multicellular filaments called hyphae, with all of the hyphae together form a mycelium, some species (such as yeasts) also grow as single cells. Sexual and asexual reproduction of the fungi is commonly via spores, often produced on specialized structures (mushrooms). Some species have lost the ability to form specialized reproductive structures, and propagate solely by vegetative growth. Yeasts, moulds (molds), and mushrooms are examples of fungi. The fungi are more closely related to animals than plants, even though the discipline devoted to the study of fungi, known as mycology, often falls under botany. True fungi lack flagella, but the chytrid ancestors are unicellular organisms that swim using flagella. Occurring worldwide, most fungi are largely invisible to the naked eye, living for the most part in soil, dead matter, and as symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi. They perform an essential role in many ecosystems in decomposing organic matter and are indispensable in nutrient cycling and exchange. Some fungi become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or moulds. Many fungal species have long been used as a direct source of food, such as mushrooms and truffles and in production of bread, and in fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Fungi are sources for antibiotics (such as penicillin) used in medicine and for various enzymes such as cellulases, pectinases, and proteases important for industrial use or as active ingredients of detergents. Many fungi produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides that are toxic to animals including humans. Some fungi are used for hallucinogenic effects. Several species of the fungi are significant pathogens of humans and other animals, and losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage caused by fungi can have a large impact on human food supply and local economies.'

Microsporidians produce resistant spores and possess a unique organelle, the polar tubule, or polar filament, which is coiled inside the spore (see below). The spores of microsporidians known to infect humans range from 1 to 4 microns in diameter. At least 14 microsporidian species have been identified as human pathogens (see Table from U.S. CDC): Brachiola algerae, B. connori, B. vesicularum, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Enc. hellem, Enc. intestinalis (formerly known as Septata intestinalis), Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Microsporidium ceylonensis, M. africanum, Nosema ocularum, Pleistophora sp., Trachipleistophora hominis, T. anthropophthera, and Vittaforma corneae.

Birds, especially parrots (parakeets, lovebirds, budgies) are naturally infected with Enc. hellem. Enterocytozoon bieneusi and V. corneae have been identified in surface waters and spores of "Nosema" (probably B. algerae) have been identified in ditch water. The infective form of microsporidians is the resistant spore, which can survive for long periods in the environment. The spore extrudes its polar tubule and infects the host cell. The spore injects the infective sporoplasm into the eukaryotic host cell through the polar tubule. Inside the cell, the sporoplasm undergoes extensive multiplication either by merogony (binary fission) or schizogony (multiple fission). This development can occur either in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm (e.g., Enterocytozoon bieneusi) or inside a vacuole known as a parasitophorous vacuole (e.g., Encephalitozoon intestinalis). Either free in the cytoplasm or inside a parasitophorous vacuole, microsporidia develop by sporogony to mature spores. During sporogony, a thick wall is formed around the spore, which provides resistance to adverse environmental conditions. When the spores increase in number and completely fill the host cell cytoplasm, the cell membrane is disrupted and releases the spores to the surroundings. These free mature spores can infect new cells, continuing the cycle. (Centers for Disease Control Parasites and Health Website) Microsporidia are being increasingly recognized as opportunistic infectious agents worldwide (Didier and Weiss 2011). Cases of microsporidiosis have been reported from developed as well as developing countries, including Argentina, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Uganda, United Kingdom, United States of America, and Zambia. (Centers for Disease Control Parasites and Health Website) Nosema microsporidians have been suspected of playing an important role in the dramatic population declines of certain bumblebee species (e.g., Cameron et al. 2011 and references therein, but see Kissinger et al. 2011) and some researchers believe Nosema has played a role in honeybee colony collapse disorder in at least some regions (Paxton 2010). Vertical transmission (i.e., from parent host to offspring) is unusually common among microsporidians. Because this mode of transmission depends on a host surviving long enough to reproduce, it is often associated with low pathogenesis. Smith (2009) reviewed the ecology and evolution of microsporidians, emphasizing both what is known and what is not known.'

Although many species are not known biologically, all glomeromycotan species are believed to form obligate symbiotic relationships with phototrophs.  Most of these relationships occur (in an enormous diversity of plant species) via formation of "arbuscular mycorrhizal" (AM) associations within the roots, which allow the fungi to use carbohydrates produced by the plant.  In exchange the fungi dramatically increase mineral uptake (phosphorus, in particular) for the plant, essentially extending the plants" root network with a vast mycorrhiza network. Glomeromycotan fungi appear to have low host specificity and a plant might be colonized by multiple species of glomeromycotan species, furthermore, the fungi themselves may form complex underground webs, even indirectly connecting the roots of different species of plants.  Glomeromycota are recorded to significantly impact the growth of most herbaceous plants and tropical trees including almost all human food crops, influence the composition of plant species in plant communities, control pests and fungal pathogens, and ameliorate effects of pollution on plant fitness.  These fungi may be fundamental in sustainable agriculture practices to solve the problem of rapidly depleting rock phosphate reserves, and are relevant to global warming as a significant CO2 sink, receiving and holding fixed carbon in the soil. Only very few plants (including less than 20% of existing vascular plants) are known to not form these AM relationships with glomeromycotans.  Some of these are plants in families Brassicaceae (e.g. cabbage, Arabidopsis), Caryophyllaceae (e.g. carnation) and Chenopodiaceae (e.g. spinach).  A small number of glomeromycotan species form other kinds of symbioses, some form external (ectomycorrhizal) associations with trees and shrubs, some form mycorrhizal associations with Asco- or Basidiomycota fungi.  One glomeromycotan (Geosiphon pyriformis), thought to be a primitive representative of the group, forms a symbiosis with cyanobacteria, in which they are the macrosymbiont, housing a consortium of the cyanobacteria in specialized bladders; a relationship possibly representing an ancestral type of symbiosis evolving before terrestrial plant life. The Glomeromycota are the oldest known fungi group, found in Ordovician fossils from 460 million years ago, and are hypothesized to have originated 600 million years ago, before the divergence of Asco- Basidiomycota fungi.  Scientists hypothesize these fungi had an important role in the process of early (rootless) land plants colonizing terrestrial habitats. The phylum Glomeromycota was created in 2001 as the smallest of the seven currently recognized fungi phyla, representing a very recent understanding of this group.  As late as 1974, glomeromycotan species were all placed in genus Endogone within Zygomycota.  Beginning in the early 2000"s molecular studies uncovered far more diversity at species-, genus- and family-level than traditional morphological characterizations documented (primarily as spore morphologies).  Glomeromycota currently is considered to contain between 150-200 "morphospecies," however this may well be an underestimate.  Nice descriptions of diversity and evolution of this group can be explored at the Schuessler lab web site.

Ascomycota is the largest phylum within the kingdom Fungi, with around 65,000 described species (Kirk et al. 2008). Ascomycota, which includes both unicellular and multicellular forms, is divided into three monophyletic subphyla: 1) Taphrinomycotina (which includes, among others, Pneumocystis jirovecii, a fungus that is often present in the lungs of healthy people but can cause pneumocystosis in individuals with weakened immune systems); 2) Saccharomycotina (which includes the "true yeasts", including among others Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Bakers Yeast] and Candida albicans, the most frequently encountered fungal pathogen of humans and often the agent responsible for vaginal yeast infections and thrush and some toenail infections, among others human medical woes); 3) Pezizomycotina (this clade, the largest subphylum of Ascomycota, includes the vast majority of filamentous, ascocarp-producing species of ascomycetes). Ascomycetes occur in terrestrial, marine, and freshwater habitats and many species play a major ecological role as decomposers. They range from microscopic to the size of large "mushrooms". The key characteristic of the Ascomycetes is the production of ascospores (by meiosis, usually followed by mitosis) in sac-like asci (singular: ascus) as part of their sexual reproduction (ascomycetes also reproduce asexually via the production of conidia, which are formed by mitosis at the tips of haploid conidiophores). In many ascomycete clades, these asci are enclosed in "fruiting bodies" (ascocarps), which include some very familiar forms such as truffles and morels. In the vast majority of the symbiotic associations known as lichens, the fungal partner is an ascomycete (and a large fraction of ascomycete species are known from lichens). Many mycorrhizae (mutualistic associations between fungi and plant root systems) involve ascomycetes as well.  A number of agriculturally important plant pathogens are ascomycetes--but so are the fungi that gave us penicillin and many cheeses (Ropars et al. 2012) and several ascomycete species have been major model organisms for research in genetics and cell biology.'

The term "pyrenomycetes" was used to unite fungi with perithecial ascomata and unitunicate asci (Luttrell 1951). Its use was discontinued based on the placement of perithecial species outside of the clade and the inclusion of species with prototunicate asci (e.g. Corollospora and Ophiostoma), in order to avoid confusion. Members of the Sordariomycetes are ubiquitous and cosmopolitan and function in virtually all ecosystems as pathogens and endophytes of plants, arthropod and mammalian pathogens, mycoparasites, and saprobes involved in decomposition and nutrient cycling. The most famous members include Cryphonectria parasitica (the causal agent of chestnut blight), Magnaporthe grisea (the cause of rice blast), and Neurospora crassa (the model organism widely used in molecular and genetic studies).'

Recent molecular studies suggest that several groups of fungi with simple, cleistothecial ascomata belong to the Leotiomycetes, including the Erysiphales, Myxotrichaceae, and Thelebolales (Blackwell et al. 2006; de Hoog et al. 2005; Gernandt et al. 2001). Conversely, other groups traditionally included in the Leotiomycetes, such as the Geoglossaceae and Orbiliaceae, have been proved to be phylogenetically distinct (Spatafora et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2006). Currently, five orders, 21 families, and about 510 genera (115 with an uncertain position) are accepted in the Leotiomycetes on the basis of both traditional classification and molecular phylogenetic studies (Eriksson 2005, Kirk et al. 2001, Hibbett et al. 2007). Morphologically and ecologically, the Leotiomycetes is a highly diverse group of the Pezizomycotina. For example, species of Cyttaria (Cyttariales) produce brightly colored globose fruiting bodies of "ping-pong ball" size on hard wood trees, while apothecia of Lophodermium (Rhytismatales) often mature as small, dark dots on conifer needles. The Erysiphales and Thelebolales are associated with distinct ecological characters and nutritional modes, in addition to morphology almost unique for each group. Members of the Helotiales thrive in various ecosystems and cover a broad range of niches, and helotialean fungi have been described as plant pathogens, endophytes, mycorrhizae, fungal parasites, terrestrial saprobes, aquatic saprobes, root symbionts, and wood rot fungi.'

Basidiomycota includes around 32,000 described species (Kirk et al. 2008). Basidiomycota is divided into three subphyla: 1) Pucciniomycotina: Most of the species in this group are parasitic plant rusts (Aime et al. 2006). 2) Ustilaginomycotina: The vast majority of species in this group, often known as smut fungi, are parasites of angiosperms [flowering plants], mainly grasses and sedges (Begerow et al. 2006). 3) Agaricomycotina: This group includes around a third of the described species of Fungi, including mushrooms, jelly fungi (Millanes et al. 2011), and basidiomycetous yeasts (Fell et al. 2000; Scorzetti et al. 2002).

Members of the Agaricomycotina display the full range of ecological strategies that characterizes the Basidiomycota as a whole. To obtain carbon nutrition, Agaricomycotina decompose dead organic matter or enter into diverse associations (both antagonistic and benign) with plants, animals, and other fungi. Mycorrhizal associations with plants are present in many lineages of Agaricomycetes, including certain jelly fungi (Selosse et al. 2002). Mycoparasitism (parasitism of a fungus by a fungus) is especially widespread in the Tremellomycetes (Bandoni 1984). Few Agaricomycotina are medically important. An exception is Filobasidiella neoformans (also called Cryptococcus neoformans), which is a serious pathogen of immunocompromised individuals (Mitchell and Perfect 1995).

Tilletia contraversa is important in the international wheat trade (Trione 1982), and 2-5% of the plants in a corn field are generally infected by Ustilago maydis, while up to 80% of a field can be infected if conditions are good for the smut fungus.

This lineage that is composed of those organisms we know as "animals" represents one of the three major origins of multicellularity (the other two large and diverse groups of multicellular organisms are the fungi and the green plants). It is difficult to list characteristics that apply to all animals, since various branches of the animal tree have undergone a range of significant modifications. However, most animals obtain energy from other organisms. They generally feed on them as predators (killing and eating a prey item); parasites, including herbivores feeding on plants (feeding on their "prey" without killing it, at least not immediately); or detritivores (ingesting tiny bits of decomposing organic material such as fallen leaves). In contrast to animals, most plants make their own food, through the extraordinary process of photosynthesis, using energy captured from the sun; most fungi break down decaying organic material (without ingesting it) into its chemical constituents and absorb released nutrients. Animal cells lack a rigid cell wall (some form of which is typical of plants and most fungi) and their cell biology and physiology differ in a variety of ways from other organisms. The diversity of animals is impressive. Zhang (2011; 2013) recently coordinated an effort to outline a classification scheme for all known animals and to estimate species richness (i.e., number of species) in different parts of the animal tree. Results from this publication are enlightening. More than 1.5 million animal species have been described (and many more continue to be discovered and formally described each year). The phylum Arthropoda (insects, spiders, crustaceans, etc.) accounts for around 80% of this total; around 2/3 of the total is accounted for by the insects alone. Well over a third of all known insects (and around a quarter of all known animal species!) are beetles: nearly 400,000 different species of beetles have already been described. Among the known species of insects are also nearly 120,000 Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps) and nearly 160,000 Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). More than 40,000 spider species and over 50,000 species of Acari (mites and ticks) have been described. Nearly 70,000 species of Crustacea (crabs, shrimps, barnacles, pillbugs, and many groups completely unfamiliar to those who do not study them!) are known. The Myriapoda (millipedes, centipedes, and relatives) includes around 12,000 described species. The Mollusca (clams, snails, octopuses, and relatives) is among the largest of the animal phyla, with nearly 120,000 known species. There are over 17,000 known species of Annelida (segmented worms, including earthworms, "polychaete" worms, leeches, and their relatives), Even some groups most people have never even heard of are quite diverse. For example, there are over 1000 described Acanthocephala, over 3000 Pseudoscorpiones, and more than 1500 Rotifera species (and rotifer specialists believe this last number may represent just a tenth or less of the true global rotifer species diversity). By comparison with these invertebrate clades, the generally more familiar vertebrate groups are less diverse, but many people may still be surprised to learn, for example, that there are around 32,000 species of described "fishes" and nearly 6,000 described mammal species. The numbers presented here are merely an appetizer. Anyone seriously interested in biodiversity will thoroughly enjoy studying the original volume by Zhang and colleagues which is freely available online.'

Most animals, including vertebrates (fishes, frogs, birds, humans), arthropods (insects, spiders, crustaceans), and molluscs (snails, mussels, squid), are part of the group Bilateria.  This name is derived from the fact that representatives generally show bilateral symmetry. A single median axis divides the body into equivalent halves that are mirror images of one another.  These halves run from the front end, which is usually differentiated into a head, to the back end, often in the form of a tail.  This body plan contrasts with that of radially symmetrical animals like jellyfish and sea anemones which have multiple similar parts arranged around a central axis, so their bodies lack a front and back end. Some bilaterians, such as sea stars and sea urchins, actually have radially symmetrical bodies.  However, it is clear that they evolved from bilaterally symmetrical ancestors, and their larvae still display bilateral symmetry. The alternative name Triploblastica is sometimes applied to this group.  This name refers to the fact that the early embryo of bilaterians (the blastula stage) is generally composed of three primary germ layers: the ectoderm (outer layer), the endoderm (inner layer), and the mesoderm (middle layer) between them.  The blastula of diploblastic animals, like corals and comb jellies, lacks a mesoderm and therefore has only two layers."

Chordata consists of two exclusively marine groups, the fish-like lancelets (Cephalocordata) and the sea squirts, salps and relatives (Tunicata) as well as the vertebrates which include fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Ambulacraria contains the exclusively marine echinoderms (sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, and sea lilies) and hemichordates (soft-bodied benthic worm-like animals). Ancestrally, all deuterostomes share a special form of embryonic development characterized by (1) indeterminate cleavage (early cells retain the capacity to develop into a complete embryo), (2) the initial opening of the developing embryo (blastopore) turning into the anus, and formation of the third body layer (mesoderm) from a pouch of the embryonic gut (archenteron).  These basic developmental patterns have been modified in various ways during the evolution of deuterostome groups, making it impossible to recognize a deuterostome lineage based on ontogenetic criteria alone (Nielsen 1995). In addition to chordates, echinoderms, and hemichordates, several other groups have been placed in the Deuterostomia.  Lophophorates (phoronids, brachiopods, and bryozoans) and chaetognaths show a mixture of protostome and deuterostome traits. Molecular evidence indicates that they are more closely related to protostomes (Halanych et al. 1995, Helmkampf et al. 2008, Marletaz et al. 2006, Matus et al. 2006, Papillon et al. 2004, Passamaneck & Halanych 2006).  Recently, the enigmatic Xenoturbellida have been aligned with deuterostomes (Bourlat et al. 2003, 2006, 2009; Perseke et al. 2007, Philippe et al. 2007, 2011), but there is also support for an alternative position of this group with the acoelomorphs near the base of the bilaterian tree (Edgecombe et al. 2011, Hejnol et al. 2009, Lundin 1998, 2001, Nielsen 2010, Pedersen and Pedersen 1986, 1988, Raikova et al. 2000).'

The vertebrates and hagfishes together comprise the taxon Craniata. The remaining chordates are the tunicates (Urochordata), lancelets (Cephalochordata), and, possibly, some odd extinct groups. With few exceptions, chordates are active animals with bilaterally symmetric bodies that are longitudinally differentiated into head, trunk and tail. The most distinctive morphological features of chordates are the notochord, nerve cord, and visceral clefts and arches. Chordates are well represented in marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats from the Equator to the high northern and southern latitudes. The oldest fossil chordates are of Cambrian age. The earliest is Yunnanozoon lividum from the Early Cambrian, 525 Ma (= million years ago), of China. This was just recently described and placed with the cephalochordates (Chen et al., 1995). Another possible cephalochordate is Pikaia (Nelson, 1994) from the Middle Cambrian. These fossils are highly significant because they imply the contemporary existence of the tunicates and craniates in the Early Cambrian during the so-called Cambrian Explosion of animal life. Two other extinct Cambrian taxa, the calcichordates and conodonts, are uncertainly related to other Chordata (Nelson, 1994). In the Tree of Life project, conodonts are placed as a subgroup of vertebrates. Chordates other than craniates include entirely aquatic forms. The strictly marine Urochordata or Tunicata are commonly known as tunicates, sea squirts, and salps. There are roughly 1,600 species of urochordates; most are small solitary animals but some are colonial, organisms. Nearly all are sessile as adults but they have free-swimming, active larval forms. Urochordates are unknown as fossils. Cephalochordata are also known as amphioxus and lancelets. The group contains only about 20 species of sand-burrowing marine creatures. The Cambrian fossils Yunnanozoon and Pikaia are likely related to modern cephalochordates. During the Ordovician Period (510 - 439 Ma) jawless or agnathan fishes appeared and diversified. These are the earliest known members of Vertebrata, the chordate subgroup that is most familiar to us. Fossils representing most major lineages of fish-like vertebrates and the earliest tetrapods (Amphibia) were in existence before the end of the Devonian Period (363 Ma). Reptile-like tetrapods originated during the Carboniferous (363 - 290 Ma), mammals differentiated before the end of the Triassic (208 Ma) and birds before the end of the Jurassic (146 Ma). The smallest chordates (e.g. some of the tunicates and gobioid fishes) are mature at a length of about 1 cm, whereas the largest animals that have ever existed are chordates: some sauropod dinosaurs reached more than 20 m and living blue whales grow to about 30 m.'

                                  desc: 'The Tunicata (=Urochordata) comprise a subphylum of the phylum Chordata, the group that includes vertebrates. Although tunicates are close relatives of the vertebrates, this relationship is not superficially obvious. The basic tunicate body form includes a body covered by a "tunic" made of a cellulose-like polysaccharide, a notochord that is restricted to the tail and usually present only in larval stages (with the exception of adult appendicularian tunicates), a dorsal nerve cord present in larval stages, and a U-shaped gut. The pharynx (branchial chamber) typically has numerous mucus-covered gill slits. Water flows into the mouth and pharynx via an incurrent siphon and exits via an excurrent siphon; the anus empties into the excurrent flow just as it leaves the body. Nearly all tunicates are marine suspension feeders, but this is otherwise a very diverse group. Although the larvaceans are entirely sexual, many tunicates also reproduce asexually. Most tunicate species are hermaphroditic. Ascidean tunicates (sea squirts, Ascidiacea) include both solitary (although individuals are sometimes clumped together) and truly compound colonial species, with many small individuals living together in a common gelatinous matrix. Individuals range in size from 1 mm to 60 cm and some colonies may measure several meters across. Water enters the body through an incurrent siphon and exits through an excurrent siphon. Both siphons are pointed upward. Ascideans have a global distribution and are found from shallow waters to the deep sea. They may attach to nearly any substratum. They are most abundant and diverse along rock shorelines and in deep sea mud. Salps (pelagic tunicates, Thaliacea) float singly or in cylindrical or chainlike colonies that may reach several meters in length. The incurrent and excurrent siphons of salps are positioned at opposite ends, providing thrust for locomotion. Most salps are gelatinous and transparent. Salps are known from throughout the oceans, but are especially abundant in tropical and subtropical waters. They occur from the ocean surface down to around 1500 meters. The larvaceans (appendicularians, Appendicularia=Larvacea) are solitary, luminescent zooplankton, rarely exceeding 5 mm. The name "larvacean" is a reference to their resemblance to the larval stages of some other tunicates. Larvaceans live in a gelatinous casing, or "house", that is secreted around the body and is involved in their complex feeding. Larvaceans feed mainly on tiny phytoplankton and bacteria-as small as 0.1 micrometers. The anus of larvaceans opens directly to the outside into the path of water flowing out of the excurrent siphon. The Sorberacea are deep sea ascidian-like tunicates that retain a dorsal nerve cord in the adult stage. They are carnivorous and lack a perforated branchial sac. The feces of salps and larvaceans, and the abandoned gelatinous casings of larvaceans (used in feeding), represent an important source of food and particulate organic carbon in the open sea. (Brusca and Brusca 2003) The precise evolutionary relationships among the chordate subphyla remain somewhat controversial, with some interpretations leading to the suggestion that Tunicata should be treated as a phylum rather than a subphylum (see General Description under Details tab).'

They can be readily recognized by the large, rounded sucker which surrounds their mouth and by their single "nostril" on the top of their head. The skin of lampreys is entirely naked ans slimy, and their seven gill openings extend behind the eyes. Whether marine or fresh water, lampreys always spaw and lay eggs in brooks and rivers. During most of their life (about seven years), they are larval; then they undergo a metamorphose and become an adult. Anadromous lampreys, when adult, return to the sea, where they become mature, and live there for one or two years. Then they return to rivers, reproduce and generally die. Many lampreys are parasites. They attach on other fishes by means of their sucker, scrape their skin with their rasping tongue, and suck their blood. All lampreys, however can also feed on small invertebrates. The sucker is also for them a means to travel upstreams in rivers. They use it to attach on stones to rest (Petromyzon, the name of the European lamprey, means "stone sucker") or on more powerful fishes which trail them. Although lampreys are sometimes regarded as a delicacy and fished in Europe, the main cause of their disappearance is water pollution, to which they (in particular larvae) are particularly sensitive. Recent lampreys, or Petromyzontiformes, include ten genera: Ichthyomyzon, Petromyzon, Caspiomyzon, Geotria, Mordacia, Eudontomyzon, Tetrapleurodon, Entosphenus, Lethenteron, and Lampetra. Lampreys have an amphitropical distribution and are restricted to relatively cold waters. Geotria and Mordacia are the only lampreys of the southern hemisphere, all other genera live in the northern hemisphere.'

They differ from all other craniates or vertebrates in having a vertically biting device, the jaws, which consist of an endoskeletal mandibular arch and a variety of exoskeletal grasping, crushing, or shearing organs, i.e. the teeth, and jaw bones. Among Recent vertebrates, the gnathostomes include sharks, rays, chimaeras, ray-finned fishes, lobe-finned fishes and land vertebrates. Extant gnathostomes fall into two major clades, the Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes. In addition, there are two extinct major gnathostome clades, the Placodermi (Early Silurian-Late Devonian) and the Acanthodii (Latest Ordovician or Earliest Silurian - Early Permian). There may be other fossil gnathostome taxa which fall outside of these four taxa. This could be the case for the Mongolepida, only known from isolated scales from the Early Silurian, and which are provisionally assigned to the chondrichthyans, yet with great reservations. The Chondrichthyes are characterized by a special type of hard tissue lining the cartilages of the endoskeleton: the prismatic calcified cartilage. Another chondrichthyan characteristic is the pelvic clasper, as special copulatory organ derived from the metapterygium, i.e. the posterior part of the pelvic fin. A pelvic clasper may, however, be present in the fossil Placodermi. Chondrichthyans include two major extant clades, the Elasmobranchii and the Holocephali, and a number of fossil clades (Cladoselachidae, Symmoriida, Xenacanthiformes, Iniopterygia, Eugeneodontida) which may fall outside these two clades. The Osteichthyes are characterized by endochondral ("spongy") bone in the endoskeleton, dermal fin rays made up by lepidotrichiae (modified, tile-shaped scales), and three pairs of tooth-bearing dermal bones lining the jaws (dentary, premaxillary and maxillary). The Osteichthyes include two major clades, the Actinopterygii and the Sarcopterygii. The Placodermi are characterized by a dermal armor consisting of a head armor and a thoracic armor. In the thoracic armor, the foremost dermal plates form a complete "ring" around the body and always include at least one median dorsal plate. The Acanthodii are characterized by dermal spines inserted in front of all fins but the caudal one. They also possess minute, growing scales which have a special onion-like structure, i.e. the crown consists of overlying layers of dentine or mesodentine.'

Amphibians are generally small with thin skin permeable to air and water. With few exceptions, amphibians do not actively care for their young. In general, amphibian reproduction strategy consists of egg-laying and external fertilization of a large number of eggs in a moist or fully aquatic environment. Fertilized eggs develop into amphibian larvae that live part of their lives dependent on an aquatic environment requiring gills and specialized feeding habits. Following a pattern of development unique to amphibians, amphibian larvae undergo marked changes and metamorphose into a terrestrial form that lives on land. Typically, this metamorphosis is demonstrated by loss of gills, changes in overall appearance, and changes in diet.Amphibians live in diverse habitats, often in large numbers, and play several important ecological roles. As consumers, amphibians help regulate populations of the organisms they consume, chiefly invertebrates. As prey items, amphibians are consumed by a variety of larger predators such as reptiles, birds, mammals, fish, predatory invertebrates, and other amphibians. When consumed by larger predators, amphibians transfer the energy and nutrients from amphibian prey items such as small invertebrates to larger predators.'

The name caecilian derives from the Latin 'caecus', meaning 'blind', due to the small or sometimes nonexistent eyes. Carolus Linnaeus named the first species he described as Caecilia tentaculata (2). Gymnophona derives from the Greek for 'naked snake', as caecilians were thought to be related to snakes. Caecilians lack limbs; smaller species superficially resemble worms, while larger species resemble snakes. The tail is short or absent and the cloaca is near the end of the body. The skin is smooth and contains calcite scales, which are probably a secondary development, rather than suggesting that caecilians are related to the fossil Stegocephalia (2). The skin has many ring-shaped folds (annuli), partially encircling the body, giving a segmented appearance. It has glands that secrete a toxin to deter predators (1). Caecilians' vision is limited to dark-light perception (4) and their anatomy is highly adapted for burrowing. They have a strong skull and use their pointed snouts to force their way through soil or mud (2). In most species, the bones in the skull are reduced in number and fused together, while the mouth is recessed under the head. The muscles are adapted to pushing their way through the ground, with the skeleton and deep muscles acting as a piston inside the skin and outer muscles. This lets the animal anchor its hind end in position, forcing the head forwards and pulling the rest of the body up to reach it in waves. In water or very loose mud, caecilians swim like eels (1). Aquatic caecilians in the family Typhlonectidae have a fleshy fin running along the rear section of their bodies to enhance propulsion in water (5). All but the most primitive caecilians have two sets of muscles to close the jaw; other creatures have one pair. These are more highly developed in the most efficient burrowing caecilians and seem to help keep the skull and jaw rigid (1). Adapting to an underground life, the eyes are small and covered by skin for protection, but caecilians are not blind. Their sight is limited to simple dark-light perception. All caecilians have a pair of tentacles, located between the eyes and nostrils. These are probably used for a second olfactory capability, in addition to the normal sense of smell based in the nose (1) Except for two lungless species (Atretochoana eiselti and Caecilita iwokramae) all caecilians have lungs, but also use their skin or mouths for oxygen absorption. Often, the left lung is much smaller than the right one, an adaptation to body shape also found in snakes. Caecilians mostly live hidden in the ground, but some live in water. They are found in wet, tropical regions of Southeast Asia, India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, parts of East and West Africa, the Seychelles, Central America, and in northern and eastern South America. In Southeast Asia, they occur as far east as Java, Borneo and the southern Philippines, but have not crossed Wallace's line and do not occur in Australia or nearby islands. Mature caecilians seem to feed mostly on insects and other invertebrates. Captives will eat earthworms. Caecilians use internal insemination. Males insert a penis-like organ, the phallodeum, into the female's cloaca for two to three hours. About 25% of lay eggs, which are guarded by the female. In some species, the young are already metamorphosed when they hatch; others hatch as larvae, which are not fully aquatic, but spend the daytime in the soil near the water (1). About 75% of caecilians give birth to already-developed offspring. The fetus is fed inside the female with cells lining the oviduct, which they eat with special scraping teeth."

Synapsids are the dominant large terrestrial animals worldwide, and they have also invaded the oceans (whales, pinnipeds) and the air (bats). The oldest known synapsid is an ophiacodontid from the Middle Pennsylvanian (320 million years ago) of Joggins, Nova Scotia. By the Lower Permian, therapsids (the group that includes mammals and most of their Upper Permian and more recent relatives) had appeared (Laurin and Reisz, 1990, 1996). However, the oldest known mammal only dates back to the Jurassic (Rowe, 1988). The fossil record of synapsids is one of the most extensive of any groups of vertebrates. This fossil record has been used to illustrate the concept of evolution (Hopson, 1987) and to test macroevolutionary patterns (Kemp, 1985). The largest gap in this fossil record is between the Permo-Carboniferous synapsids and therapsids. The fossil record provides conclusive evidence that synapsids are the first amniotes to diversify. Synapsids quickly became the most diverse, widespread and most common amniotes in the Late Carboniferous, and they maintained this predominant position throughout the Paleozoic. Only during the Early Mesozoic are the synapsids eclipsed by the evolutionary radiation of reptiles (Benton, 1983; Charig, 1984). Within the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian, two different herbivorous and several faunivorous synapsid groups can be recognized. The fossil record suggests that during the Carboniferous and Early Permian, synapsids and other amniotes were restricted to the paleoequatorial and subequatorial regions. During the Late Permian, the distribution of synapsids, and of some of the other amniotes becomes cosmopolitan. However, the evidence for this pattern rests on rather weak negative evidence (i. e., no Permo-Carboniferous synapsids have been found outside paleoequatorial regions, but other areas have not been prospected intensively). Early synapsids had a sprawling posture and a small brain, like most early tetrapods. The parasagittal gait characteristic of most mammals (Fig. 1) appeared gradually because some therapsids were apparently capable of sprawling and parasagittal gait, and this character may have appeared in the hind limb before the fore limb. Early synapsids were moderately large (body length between 50 cm and 3 m) and most were carnivorous or insectivorous, but caseids and Edaphosaurus were herbivorous. Mammals include the largest tetrapods that ever lived (the blue whale is larger than any dinosaur), as well as very small species. Most mammals are viviparous, but the platypus (a monotreme) is oviparous, and most, if not all, non-mammalian synapsids were probably oviparous. All mammals have mammary glands, but the presence of these structures cannot be determined in extinct taxa. The oldest preserved synapsid hair appears to belong to a Middle Jurassic docodontan mammaliaform (a stem-synapsid) from China (Ji et al., 2006). However, hair is infrequently fossilized and the next oldest record is from a Paleocene multituberculate (Meng and Wyss, 1997). Therefore, its real date of appearance is unknown. The position of this group has been debated, but they are probably mammals (Rowe, 1988), so the presence of hair in multituberculates was predictible.'

Radiations took place on both of these continents during the Cenozoic, at a time when there were few placental competitors. Present marsupial faunas are very diverse, with some startling parallels with placental mammals (e.g. marsupials with similar morphologies and life histories as moles, anteaters, shrews, primates, carnivores, and many others). Some marsupial life histories and morphologies are seemingly without placental mammal parallels, for example, kangaroos. Past marsupial faunas were even more incredible. In Australia, for example, were rhinoceros-sized marsupial herbivores, kangaroos nearly 10 feet tall, and carnivorous lion-like forms with shearing teeth and retractile claws. In South America, where parallel radiations of large placental herbivores may have denied these herbivorous niches to marsupials, marsupials filled many carnivore niches (including a sabretooth marsupial "cat") and many rodent-like forms. It seems clear on both continents that invasion by placental mammals is correlated with a decline in number and diversity of marsupials. However, it is unclear whether placental mammals caused the disappearance of marsupials through competition or the apparent pattern of replacement is the result of random historical events.'

They have invaded all major habitats, from the polar circles (many migratory birds) to deserts (many lizards) and even the ocean (sea snakes, sauropterygians). Diapsids include most flying vertebrates (birds) and most poisonous chordates (snakes and the Gila Monster). The early history of diapsids is poorly documented. Until the late seventies, the oldest known diapsids were the Upper Permian (250 Myr old) younginiforms from South Africa and Madagascar (Harris and Carroll, 1977; Currie, 1980, 1981, and 1982), and a few other contemporaneous diapsids of uncertain affinities (Carroll, 1976a and b). However, recent work (Reisz, 1977) has extended the fossil record of diapsids to the Pennsylvanian (about 300 Myr ago), and greatly increased our knowledge of the diversity of early diapsids (Brinkman et al., 1984; Reisz et al., 1984; Laurin, 1991; deBraga and Reisz, 1995). The oldest known crown-diapsids (saurians) date from the Late Upper Permian (Carroll, 1975; Evans, 1987). Extant diapsids are classified into either lepidosaurs (lizards and Sphenodon) or archosaurs (birds and crocodiles). Both of these clades are very successful and speciose (Fig. 1), and archosaurs include some of the most fascinating vertebrates that ever lived, such as the pterosaurs (flying reptiles of the Mesozoic) and the many extinct groups of dinosaurs. Indeed, the present diversity of archosaurs, even though it compares favourably with many other clades, is a mere shadow of what it was in the mesozoic. Diapsida was named after the two fenestrae (holes) found in the temporal region of the skull of most early and some extant diapsids. The lower temporal fenestra is between the jugal, postorbital, squamosal, and quadratojugal. The upper temporal fenestra is between the postorbital, parietal, and squamosal. Some diapsids have lost the lower fenestra (lizards) or even both fenestrae (snakes, amphisbaenids), but their early ancestors had both fenestrae.'

Aves is the latin name for the birds - feathered, winged, bipedal, warm-blooded, egg-laying, vertebrate animals with evolutionary origins among the reptiles. The taxon has been historically treated as equal to fish, amphibia, reptiles and mammals, but in order to make classifications reflect evolutionary history, they are now more usually regarded as falling inside the Reptilia. Around 10,000 living species makes them the most speciose class of tetrapod vertebrates. They inhabit ecosystems across the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Extant birds range in size from the 5 cm Bee Hummingbird to the 2.75 m Ostrich. The fossil record indicates that birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the Jurassic period, around 160 million years (Ma) ago. Birds are the only clade of dinosaurs to have survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 65.5 Ma ago. Modern birds are characterised by feathers, a beak with no teeth, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. All living species of birds have wings. Wings are evolved forelimbs, and most bird species can fly; exceptions include the ostriches, emus and relatives, penguins, and some endemic island species. Birds also have unique digestive and respiratory systems that are well suited to their flying needs. Some birds, especially corvids and parrots, are among the most intelligent animal species; a number of bird species have been observed manufacturing and using tools, and many social species transmit knowledge across generations. Many species undertake long distance annual migrations, and many more perform shorter irregular movements.Many species are social and communicate using visual signals and through calls and songs, and participate in social behaviours, including cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other species have polygynous ("many females") or, rarely, polyandrous ("many males") breeding systems. Eggs are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Many species are of economic importance, mostly as sources of food acquired through hunting or farming. Some species, particularly songbirds and parrots, are popular as pets. Other uses include the harvesting of guano (droppings) for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure prominently in all aspects of human culture from religion to poetry to popular music. About 120-130 species have become extinct as a result of human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Currently about 1,200 species of birds are threatened with extinction by human activities, though efforts are underway to protect them.'

They also possess movable quadrate bones, making it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the braincase. This is particularly visible in snakes, which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey. They are the most variably sized order of reptiles, ranging from the 16 mm (0.63 in) dwarf gecko (Sphaerodactylus ariasae) to the 6.6 m (22 ft) green anaconda (Eunectes murinus) and the now-extinct mosasaurs, which reached lengths of 14 m (46 ft). Among the other reptiles, squamates are most closely related to tuataras, which superficially resemble lizards.'

Actinopterygians, or "ray-finned fishes," are the largest and most successful group of fishes and make up half of all living vertebrates. While actinopterygians appeared in the fossil record during the Devonian period, between 400-350 million years ago (Ma), it was not until the Carboniferous period (360 Ma) that they had become dominant in freshwaters and started to invade the seas. At present, approximately 42 orders, 431 families, and nearly 24,000 species are recognized within this class but there are bound to be taxonomic revisions as research progresses. Teleosts comprise approximately 23,000 of the 24,000 species within the actinopterygians, and 96 percent of all living fish species (see Systematic/Taxonomic History). The latter estimates, however, will probably never be accurate because actinopterygian species are becoming extinct faster than they can be discovered in some areas, such as the Amazon and Congo Basins. Unfortunately, habitat destruction, pollution and international trade, among other human impacts, have contributed to the endangerment of many actinopterygians (see Conservation Status). Clearly, given the enormous diversity of this class, entire books could be (and are) written for each of the categories below, so this account does not attempt an exhaustive summary of the diversity of habitats, body forms, behaviors, reproductive habits, etc. of actinopterygians. Instead, each section introduces important   ichthyological concepts and terminology, as well as numerous examples from a diverse range of ray-finned fish families. A section of particular interest is Systematic/Taxonomic History because salient features of the evolutionary history of actinopterygians are discussed. The   phylogenetic trends within early actinopterygians provide a basis for understanding why this group has been so successful, as more derived forms (i.e. neopterygians and teleosts), which make up nearly all existing ray-finned fishes, have repeated and extended early trends. Many of the sections, such as Physical Description, Reproduction, Behavior and Ecosystem Roles merely scratch the surface, but there are numerous links to family-level ray-finned fish accounts.

A large study in 2008 by Dunn et al. strongly supported the Ecdysozoa as a clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants. The group is also supported by morphological characters, and can be considered as including all animals that shed their exoskeleton (see ecdysis). Groups corresponding roughly to the Ecdysozoa had been proposed previously by Perrier in 1897 and Seurat in 1920 based on morphology alone. The group has been contested by a significant minority of biologists. Some have argued for groupings based on more traditional taxonomic techniques (Nielsen 1995), while others have contested the interpretation of the molecular data (Blair et al. 2002, Wagele et al. 1999).'

They are bilaterally symmetrical (there is a left/right symmetry), their bodies are made up from a series of segments, and they have paired and usually jointed appendages on some or all of the body segments. The body is protected by a tough organic or organic-mineral cuticle which functions as an exoskeleton. In order to grow, arthropods periodically shed their cuticle by a process called ecdysis. Insects, spiders, crustacea, trilobites are all types of arthropods.'

All living species are terrestrial, but a number of marine species are known from the fossil record going back to the Early Cambrian over 500 million years ago. Living Onychophora are found in humid habitats, stashing themselves away in burrows or other retreats and becoming inactive during dry periods. During wet periods, they can be found sifting through leaf litter. One particularly unusual aspect of onychophoran behavior is their method of prey capture, which involves shooting twin streams of a rapidly hardening adhesive slime up to 30 cm to entangle their prey, as can be seen here. (Brusca and Brusca 2003) With the exception of just a few species, onychophorans have not been well studied and the New World fauna is especially poorly known (Read 1988).'

                              desc: 'Around 150 species of kinorhynchs have been described since this group was first discovered on the northern coast of France in 1841, nearly all of them less than 1 mm long. They have been collected as far north as Greenland and as far south as Antarctica, as well as in the Black Sea. Most live in marine sand or mud from the intertidal zone to a depth of 5000 to 8,000 meters, but some are known from algal mats or holdfasts, sandy beaches, and brackish estuaries and others have been found living on hydrozoans, bryozoans, or sponges. The general morphology of kinorhynchs is fairly homogeneous. The body includes a head (which can be retracted into the anterior portion of the neck), with both anteriorly and posteriorly directed spines, and a trunk. The body is divided into 13 distinct "zonites" (the head and neck being formed by the first two zonites and the trunk by the remaining 11), which are viewed as true segments by many specialists. The anus is on the last segment and is usually flanked by strong lateral spines. Kinorhynchs apparently lack a coelom (distinct body cavity). Like arthropods (and most or all other groups in the superclade Ecdysozoa), kinorhynchs periodically shed their chitinous cuticle as they grow, but apparently do not molt as adults. Kinorhynchs lack circular body muscles and do not swim. They move and burrow by forcing body fluid into the head to extend it into the substratum, anchoring the anterior spines, then pulling the rest of the body forward. Little is known about kinorhynch feeding, but they are likely direct deposit feeders, ingesting the substratum and digesting the organic material or consuming unicellular algae (they have been found with their guts full of benthic diatoms). Kinorhynchs have separate males and females, which are generally externally indistinguishable. Little is known about the reproduction or embryology of kinorhynchs. Fertilized eggs are deposited in egg cases and development is direct (no distinct larval stage), with juveniles emerging from egg cases with 11 of the 13 body segments already formed, the last 2 segments being added during the juvenile molts (Brusca and Brusca 2003 and references therein; Margulis and Chapman 2010). The Kinorhyncha are believed to be closely related to both the Priapula and Loricifera, with which they are often grouped in a clade referred to as Scalidophora; some authors include the Nematomorpha as well in a clade referred to as Cephalorhyncha (Aleshin et al. 1998 and references therein; Halanych 2004 and references therein). Both morphological and molecular data indicate that the phylum Priapulida is the sister group to the Kinorhyncha, although it is possible that the Loricifera are more closely related to one of these groups than the other (e.g., Kristensen 2002; Mallat and Giribet 2006; Telford et al. 2008). Sorensen et al. (2008) present data that they argue supports a sister relationship between Loricifera and Nematomorpha, which would render the Scalidophora paraphyletic. As of 2010, relationships among phyla within the Ecdysozoa remain poorly resolved, so it is difficult to know which groups will eventually win wide acceptance by specialists as convincingly monophyletic.'

Researchers continue to find new species, indicating that this is an abundant and cosmopolitan taxon, with worldwide distribution and occurring in sediments from shallow to deep water. Loricifera are interesting as "masters of miniturization" (Rundell & Leander 2010) but also as "the first evidence of a metazoan life cycle that is spent entirely in permanently anoxic sediments" (Danovaro et al 2010). Loriciferans are similar in size to large single-celled protozoans (< 0.5 mm) but are multicellular, with about 10,000 specialized cells creating a tiny but complex body with a brain, digestive and excretory systems, specialized appendages, sense organs, musculature and locomotory functions, separate sexes, and a protective external cuticle (the "lorica") into which the "introvert" containing the mouth cone and head can be retracted (Ruppert et al 2004).'

They can be found from polar seas to the tropics and from ocean trenches to the intertidal zone. Some species can occur in extremely high densities. Sexes are separate and in at least one family sexual dimorphism is evident. Males spawn first, then females; fertilization is external. Nearly all species have a non-swimming benthic larval stage, which apparently may last as long as one to two years. Larvae live in mud and are probably detritivores. The body of a priapulan is cylindrical and includes an introvert (retractable and invertible proboscis), a neck-like collar, a trunk, and sometimes a "tail". The introvert has spines resembling those on the introvert of kinorhynchs and loriciferans. Large priapulans burrow actively in relatively fine marine sediments, primarly in boreal and cold temperate seas. A few species construct tubes. Small priapulans burrow or live interstitially among sediment particles. Priapulans are relatively common in the fossil record and may have been important predators in Cambrian seas. Most priapulans today live in soft sediments and feed on soft-bodied invertebrates such as polychaete worms and other priapulans. During feeding, a portion of the toothed pharynx is everted through the mouth at the end of the extended introvert, then retracted together with the prey item.

                              desc: 'Annelida is a group commonly referred to as segmented worms, and they are found worldwide from the deepest marine sediments to the soils in our city parks and yards. Through most of the 20th century Annelida was split into three major groups; Polychaeta, Oligochaeta (earthworms etc.) and Hirudinea (leeches). Earthworms and leeches are the familiar annelids for most people, but polychaetes comprise the bulk of the diversity of Annelida and are found in nearly every marine habitat, from intertidal algal mats downwards. There are even pelagic polychaetes that swim or drift, preying on other plankton, and a few groups occurring in fresh water and moist terrestrial surroundings. Around 9000 species of polychaetes are currently recognized with several thousand more names in synonymy, and the overall systematics of the group remains unstable (Rouse and Pleijel, 2001). It is now recognized that Oligochaeta and Hirudinea, comprised of several thousand species, form a clade and should be referred to either as Oligochaeta (Siddall et al., 2001) or Clitellata (Martin, 2001). Moreover, it is possible that this group may well belong inside Polychaeta, thus making Polychaeta synonymous with Annelida (McHugh, 1997; Westheide, 1997; Westheide et al., 1999). Echiura (spoon worms), at one time regarded as an annelid group (Sedgwick, 1898), has been excluded from Annelida for many years (Newby, 1940). Evidence now suggests they are in fact annelids (Hessling and Westheide, 2002; McHugh, 1997), though their placement within the group is unresolved. The former phyla Pogonophora and Vestimentifera have also recently become regarded as a single, clearly annelid, group (Bartolomaeus, 1995; Nielsen, 1995; Rouse and Fauchald, 1995), and are now known by the original name, Siboglinidae (see Rouse and Fauchald , 1997 and McHugh 1997). Undoubted annelid fossils, such as Canadia, are known from the Burgess Shale deposits. Until relatively recently the most commonly used system to divide polychaetes was as "Errantia" and "Sedentaria". This was essentially a system of convenience with no real intention of depicting evolutionary relationships. This classification was supplanted in the 1960s and 1970s by ones which split polychaetes into as many as 22 orders with no explicit linkage between them (Fauchald and Rouse, 1997). A recent cladistic analysis of Annelida and other groups has resulted in a new classification of polychaetes (Rouse and Fauchald, 1997), with the group split into two main clades Scolecida and Palpata. Scolecida is a small group of less than 1000 named species, and these worms are all burrowers of one form or another, with bodies reminiscent of earthworms. Palpata comprises the vast majority of polychaetes and is divided into Aciculata and Canalipalpata. Aciculata contains about half of the polychaete species and largely encompasses the old taxonomic group Errantia. Representatives of this lineage are characterized by having internal supporting chaetae, or aciculae, in the parapodia. It includes major groups such as Phyllodocida and Eunicida, which tend to be mobile forms with well developed eyes and parapodia for rapid locomotion. Canalipalpata, a group with more than 5000 named species, is distinguished by having long grooved palp structures that are used for feeding. Canalipalpata is divided into Sabellida, Spionida and Terebellida. Most of these groups" members live in tubes and use their palps to feed in various ways.'

Having said that, there are notable exceptions, including a genus of solitary species (Monobryozoon), a mobile species (Cristatella mucedo), and a recently found planktonic species (in genus Alcyonidium) that floats as a ball (Peck et al. 1995). Like the phoronids and the brachiopods they feed using a specialized horseshoe-shaped structure called a lophophore. Known also as "moss animals," there are somewhere between 4000-6000 living species, some estimate that number closer to 8000 species (Ryland 2005). Most bryozans are marine or brackish, fewer than 100 species live in freshwater (Massard and Geimer 2007). About 15,000 fossil species have been found, dating from the early Ordovician/late Cambrian. Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate that bryozoans originated earlier in the Cambrian period (along with almost all other invertebrate phyla) and that the earliest bryozoans were non-calcified, thus did not fossilize (Fuchs et al. 2009).'

They are widely distributed throughout the oceans from the tropical intertidal to cold deep-water habitats. These little-known marine invertebrates are often confused with holothurians, echiurans or nemerteans and are easily overlooked by inexperienced observers. However sipunculans have several characteristics that separate them easily from these other groups. The body consists of a cylindrical trunk and an introvert that invaginates completely inside the trunk. The mouth is located at the tip of the introvert and may be surrounded by digitiform tentacles. The peculiar position of the anus in the antero-dorsal region of the trunk is an easily seen external character that distinguishes the sipunculans from other worm-like invertebrates. Sipunculans are dioecious but sexes are not distinguishable externally. Fertilization is external and development may be either direct with no larval form or indirect, usually with a trochophore larva followed by a pelagosphera, a larval type unique to sipunculans. Pelagosphera larvae of many species can spend long periods of time in the water column; consequently they are capable of long distance dispersal. At least one species (Aspidosiphon elegans) is able to reproduce asexually by fission of small pieces from the posterior. As infaunal animals, sipunculans burrow into the substrate or they are cryptic inhabitants of coral rubble or empty gastropod shells and are therefore not readily observed or collected. The phylogenetic position of sipunculans has been contentious. This group has been ranked at differing taxonomic levels such as family, order, class or phylum (Saiz Salinas, 1993; Cutler, 1994). Phylum status for this group was established only in the middle of the 20th century (Hyman, 1959) and the current name, Sipuncula, was proposed by Stephen (1964) and restated by Stephen and Edmonds (1972). More recently, molecular phylogenetic studies have provided strong evidence that sipunculans are either within, or closely related to, annelids (e.g. Boore & Staton, 2002; Struck et al. 2007; Dunn et al. 2008; Dordel et al. 2010).'

In contrast to these well-known molluscs, however, others are almost never seen, such as the aplacophorans and monoplacophorans, the latter of which which were only known from Paleozoic fossils until the first live specimen was discovered in the deep sea in 1952 (UCMP 2008). Except for the aplacophorans, most molluscs have a well-developed, muscular foot. This structure is used in a multitude of ways, for example: locomotion, clinging to surfaces, burrowing, anchoring in sediment, swimming, and grasping (modified into prehensile tentacles in octopuses). The vast diversity of foot adaptations exemplifies the huge morphological diversity of the mollusc form. A layer of epidermal tissue called the mantle surrounds the body of molluscs. Specialized glands in the mantle are responsible for the extracellular excretions that form shell structures. In all molluscan groups the shell is produced in layers of (usually) calcium carbonate, either in calcite or aragonite form. Molluscs have adapted to terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats all over the globe, although most molluscs are marine. Nearly 100,000 mollusc species are known (excluding the large number of extinct species known only as fossils) and it is clear that many thousands of species of extant species remain undescribed. Around 80% of known molluscs are gastropods (snails and slugs).'

Nemerteans have an unsegmented body, thin and elongated with no differentiated head. Unlike flatworms, which they resemble in many ways, they have a separate mouth and anus, and a digestive tract that runs the full length of their body. Very distinctive is their eversible proboscis, which is stored in the body-length long fluid-filled rhyncocoel when not in use. When activated, it is forced inside out with hydrostatic pressure from body muscle contractions to wrap around its prey , often administering venom through rhabdites (holes). Some species (members of the order Hoplonemertea) are armed with a pointed stylet at the tip of the proboscis, which the animal uses to puncture and kill its prey. Since stylets are frequently lost or broken in hunting, and growing worms require larger stylets, the stylets are continually formed (in large epithelial cells) and stored so there is always one on hand to replace an old or lost one. Nemerteans have more developed muscle than flatworms, and can contract their body to up to a tenth of their extended length. They use body muscles to locomote (and have cilia covering their epidermis and lots of gland cells for mucus production so they glide across surfaces). They also use body musculature to move food through their gut and blood through their circulatory system.'

                              desc: 'The phylum Entoprocta (=Kamptozoa) includes around 180 known species (Iseto and Hirose 2010) and the actual world fauna likely exceeds 500 species (Nielsen 1989). Entoprocts are small, transparent, sessile (i.e., fixed to the substrate), solitary or colonial animals that superficially resemble cnidarian hydroids and ectoprocts ( = bryozoans in some usage, see below). They are largely radially symmetrical. Entoprocts are found along the coasts of every continent, including Antarctica. All but two known species are marine, but one of the two freshwater species, Urnatella gracilis, is known from every continent except Antarctica and, in contrast to other entoprocts, forms massive growths that may be quite conspicuous to the naked eye (Nielsen 1989). Colonial entoprocts (around a quarter of known species, Nielsen 2010) may live attached to algae, shells, rocks, or other living or non-living substrates. Solitary species may be commensal on a variety of hosts, such as sponges, ectoprocts, polychaetes, sipunculans, and ascidians and are typically associated with just one or a few host species. Some solitary entoprocts are found on non-living substrates. Although entoprocts are found mainly in shallow water such as in the intertidal zone, some species may occur to depths as great as 500 meters. (Brusca and Brusca 2003; Fuchs et al. 2010; Margulis and Chapman 2010) Entoprocts are suspension feeders, extracting food particles (mainly phytoplankton) from currents produced by the lateral cilia on their tentacles. The dorsal suface of these animals is attached to the stalk and the ventral side faces upward. Water currents pass from dorsal to ventral, flowing between the tentacles. Food is trapped by the lateral cilia and moved in a sheet of mucus to the frontal cilia, which move the mucus and food to food grooves at the base of the ring of tentacles. (Brusca and Brusca 2003) Colony growth occurs by budding. Solitary forms also reproduce by budding. Sexual reproduction occurs as well. Colonial forms may have hermaphroditic or (more commonly) dioecious (i.e., separate sex) zooids, and a colony may contain just one or both sexes. Larvae are typically free-swimming and planktotrophic (i.e., feeding in the water column), although a few species produce lecithotrophic (non-feeding) or benthic crawling larvae. Following a brief swimming phase, larvae of most species settle, affix to a substrate, and metamorphose into adults (larvae of a few species do not metamorphose but bud instead). (Brusca and Brusca 2003; Fuchs et al. 2010) During most of the 18th and 19th centuries, entoprocts and ectoprocts were included together in the phylum Bryozoa. For most of the 20th century, however, the Entoprocta have been treated as a distinct phylum that may not even be closely related to the ectoprocts (with the ectoprocts being referred to as either Ectoprocta or Bryozoa). Beginning in the 1970s, some authors have been arguing that the entoprocts and ectoprocts may indeed be very closely related (Nielsen 2001 and references therein). Recently, some molecular data have supported this position (Hausdorf et al. 2007; Hejnol et al. 2009), although it appears that the sister group to Ectoprocta may be (Entoprocta + Cycliophora), as was originally suggested by Funch and Kristensen (1995). However, some other analyses have suggested that Ectoprocta may not be very close to (Entoprocta + Cycliophora) (Passamaneck & Halanych 2006; Hejnol et al. 2009; Fuchs et al. 2010; Mallatt et al. 2010).'

Phoronids generally live in the shallow waters of continental shelves, with the chitinous tubes they secrete either buried in sand or attached to rocks or the shells of other invertebrates (some species can bore into rock and shell). The diameter of phoronids is only about 1 - 3 mm, but they range in length from 2 - 20 cm. The body-plan is fairly simple, consisting of the anterior lophophore - whose ciliated tentacles can be organized in a ring, a horseshoe, or a spiral around the mouth - the trunk, and the ampulla, the swollen posterior end. In addition to its use as a feeding organ, the lophophore is used for gas exchange. Species with larger body-size have lophophores with proportionately more tentacles and, therefore, more complex overall lophophore shape. Phoronids have specialized blood vessels containing hemocytes with hemoglobin, which is unusual in invertebrates. Most phoronids reproduce clonally and sexually and most are hermaphrodites. Packages of sperm are released into the surrounding water where they"re collected by the lophophores of other individuals. Eggs are fertilized internally, and zygotes are either released into the plankton or brooded in the lophophore.'

There are two highly divergent extant classes of brachiopods. The Inarticulata (with about 45 species) appeared first in the fossil record at the beginning of the Cambrian; these were followed by the Articulata (290+ species).

                      desc: 'Members of the Myxozoa are microscopic metazoan parasites with an extremely reduced body. The dimensions of the myxospore, the typical myxozoan stage in fish hosts, range usually between one hundredth and two hundredth of a millimetre. Myxospores consist of several cells, which are transformed to shell valves, nematocyst-like polar capsules with coiled extrudible polar filaments and amoeboid infective germs. Myxospores develop in plasmodia (trophozoites), which can be very large and polysporic (generally histozoic in host tissue) or small and mono- or disporic (coelozoic in organ cavities). Myxozoans are parasites of fish, worms (oligochaetes and polychaetes) and bryozoans. Few representatives were found as parasites of amphibians and reptiles, and recent findings confirmed the ability of myxozoans to infect mammals (Prunescu et al. 2007, Dykova et al. 2007) and birds (Bartholomew et al. 2008). Humans as potential hosts for myxosporea were also reported (Boreham et al. 1998, Moncada et al. 2001), however, myxospores were detected in faecal samples and probably just passed through the digestive tract. Myxozoa Grasse, 1970 contains two classes: Malacosporea Canning, Curry, Feist, Longshaw et Okamura, 2000 and Myxosporea Buetschli, 1881. Malacosporea includes only two genera (Tetracapsuloides and Buddenbrockia) with a total of three described species. Myxosporea includes about 2200 species in 60 genera. Wolf and Markiw (1984) discovered myxosporean life cycles altering between two host species - fish and annelid worm. The myxospore is ingested by annelids and then the myxosporean undergoes a schizogony and a gametogony. Finally, the parasite develops into an actinospore, a triradiate myxosporean spore, which infects the vertebrate host. Here, the sporoplasm released from the actinospore divides by endogony, and then presporogenic multiplication of the myxosporean occurs. The life cycle is completed with the development of mature myxospores in sporogonic plasmodia. The annelids are definitive hosts whereas vertebrates are intermediate hosts for Myxosporea. Myxozoans were considered to be protists for more then one hundred years until the early nineties of 20th century. Then, the phylogenetic analysis of the primal myxosporean SSU rDNA sequence (Smothers et al. 1994) confirmed earlier hypotheses that myxozoans are multicellular organisms (tolc 1899, Weill 1938) and placed Myxozoa inside Metazoa. However, SSU rDNA data failed to find the correct position of the Myxozoa within metazoan taxa. Myxozoan SSU rDNA appeared to be a fast-evolving sequence resulting in long-branches in phylogenetic trees. Therefore, the SSU rDNA data are insufficient to decide whether Myxozoa are closely related either to Bilateria, Cnidaria (including Polypodium hydriforme) or other taxa (Smothers et al. 1994, Siddall et al. 1995, Hanelt et al. 1996, Siddall and Whiting 1999). The rediscovery of Buddenbrockia plumatellae, a worm-like animal, as a myxozoan species was an important clue to the origin of Myxozoa (Monteiro et al. 2002). SSU rDNA of this enigmatic worm showed its close relationship to Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, and B. plumatellae was assigned to Malacosporea, the sister group to Myxosporea. Consequently Myxozoa were considered to be bilaterians or their close relatives (Monteiro et al. 2002). However, phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of numerous protein-coding genes (Jimenez-Guri et al. 2007) excluded a bilaterian origin of B. plumatellae and suggested Cnidaria as the most closely related taxon to Myxozoa. The malacosporean Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae and some myxosporean species are of economic importance causing significant losses of farm-reared fish. T. bryosalmonae causes dangerous proliferative kidney disease of salmonids (Kent et al. 1994). Probably the most serious myxosporean pathogen is Myxobolus cerebralis (whirling disease) which infects cartilage of freshwater salmonids and causes vast losses due to death (Nehring and Walker 1996). The other economically important species are e. g. Enteromyxum leei (enteromyxosis) (Palenzuela et al. 2002), Henneguya ictaluri (proliferative gill diseases) (Pote et al. 2000) and Kudoa thyrsites (post-harvest soft flesh) (Kent et al. 1994).'

While the polyp form is adapted for a sedentary or sessile lifestyle, the medusa form is adapted for floating or free-swimming. Sea anemones and corals (class Anthoza) are all polyps.

Typically they are attached to a substrate, have a columnar body with an opening at the top, and arms radiate around the opening. The name means flower animals, a reference to the floral appearance of their perennial polyp stage. Food, mostly small plankton but some species can catch fish, is captured by nematocysts on the arm, and pushed through the opening to be digested inside the body. Unlike other cnidarians, anthozoans do not have a medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release sperm and eggs that form a planula, which attaches to some substrate on which the cnidarian grows. Some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding. The gastrovascular cavity that the mouth opens into is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions, or mesenteries. The gonads are also located within the cavity walls. Some species harbour photosynthetic dinoflagellates or zooxanthellae, in a symbiotic relationship; the reef building corals known as hermatypic corals rely on this symbiotic relationship particularly. The zooxanthellae benefit by having access to nitrogenous waste and carbon dioxide produced by the host or , and the cnidarian gains products of photosynthesis and an increased to deposit calcium carbonate. The association created coral reef systems, entirely new and rich ecosystems, the evolution of which reveals the property of emergence - the result is not simply a sum of the parts. Anemones and certain species of coral live in isolation, however most corals form colonies of genetically identical polyps; these polyps closely resemble anemonies in structure, although are generally considerably smaller. Stony coral live in all parts of the underwater world, but corals with symbionts occur in shallow waters around tropical islands and coasts. They provide a rich source of food and provide physical protection for shores. Corals are threatened by increasing acidification of the oceans.'

The lens is capable of producing very sharp images, as good as human eyes but the focal length is longer than the distance between the lens and the retina making box jellyfish strangely far-sighted.

However, the cells of the upper and lower layers differ in shape and there is a consistent dorsal-ventral orientation of the body relative to the substrate. Trichoplax moves by ciliary gliding, changing its shape along the edges as it moves, like an amoeba. Very small (presumably young) individuals can swim, but larger individuals crawl. It appears that Trichoplax feeds by phagocytosis of organic detritus. (Brusca and Brusca 2003) Although the discovery and description of Trichoplax adhaerens in 1883 (in saltwater tanks in Austria) sparked controversy among zoologists about what its significance might be with respect to inferring the characteristics of early metazoans, interest faded away as the (incorrect) idea took hold that these enigmatic organisms were simply abnormal larvae of hydrozoan cnidarians. Although strong evidence against this view was published in 1912 and 1914, there was no more discussion of Trichoplax in the zoological literature--nor citation of the key critiques of 1912 and 1914-- for more than half a century (although the misconception that it was a cnidarian was repeated in textbooks). Beginning in the 1960s, several researchers re-focused attention on Trichoplax, demonstrating that it is an adult form of a new phylum dubbed, in 1971, Placozoa. It became clear that placozoans could be found worldwide in the shallow waters of subtropical and tropical regions (Pearse 1989; Eitel and Schierwater 2010). (Syed and Schierwater 2002) Recent data all indicate that the Placozoa represent one of the earliest branching lineages in the metazoan tree, but the exact placement of this branch remains uncertain (Schierwater et al. 2009; Ball and Miller 2010 and references therein).'

Occasionally, they also occur in shallower water accessible to divers, such as submarine caves in the Mediterranean Sea or off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, where they form massive structures analogous to Mesozoic sponge reefs (see below). These mostly inconspicuously coloured sponges are highly variable in body shape (e.g. sac-, vase-, blade-shaped, composed of branching tubes etc.) and often provide substrate and shelter (and sometimes food) for diverse invertebrates and fish. Glass sponges are viviparous and produce distinctive trichimella larvae. Like most sponges, they are filter feeders. To date, about 600 extant species are described, which is certainly an underestimate of their true diversity, given their remote habitats and very few taxonomic experts for the group. Iconic glass sponges include the venus flower baskets (Euplectella and related genera), which often enclose a pair of shrimps inside their bodies and were used as bridal gifts in ancient Japan, and Monorhaphis chuni, which anchors its body in the soft deep-sea floor with a single giant (up to 3 m long) spicule.'

Some parasitize plants, invertebrate animals and other protists. A few have become algae by enslaving photosynthetic prey to form permanent cellular chimaeras. Free-living Cercozoa feed on bacteria, fungi, algae, other protozoa or even microscopic animals. They may be the most numerous predators on earth, but unlike most predators they generally lack a mouth as they can catch prey over much of their typically soft body surface. Their ancestral body plan was a predatory, phagotrophic amoeboflagellate with one anterior and one posterior cilium. One lineage enslaved a green algal cell to become the chimaeric chlorarachnean algae, which still retain the nucleus (as a miniaturized nucleomorph), former plasma membrane (as the periplastid membrane), and chloroplast of the enslaved green alga. Cercozoa have diversified into so many distinct lineages that body plans have become extremely varied. Some have lost cilia altogether and become amoebae with thread-like (filose) or net-like (reticulose) pseudopodia for locomotion and prey entrapment. These filose or reticulose amoebae are either naked or have evolved rigid tests (like a shell), which happened independently for at least three groups (euglyphid, tectofilosid, and gromiid testate amoebae). Some have evolved radiating axopodia supported by microtubules to catch prey instead (Phaeodarea, desmothoracids) and thus mimic radiolaria or heliozoa. Others have abandoned pseudopodia and become pure flagellates, either gliding on surfaces or swimming in the plankton. Many have retained cilia (sometimes reduced to one or increased to four or more) and pseudopods. Cell surfaces of the flagellates are generally naked and quite soft, lacking the complex pellicles found in alveolates and excavates, but thaumatomonads have evolved a semi-rigid covering of complex silica scales, which still allows branching filopodia to be used for feeding and cilia to propel the cells by gliding. Cercozoa were only recently recognised as a monophyletic group (Cavalier-Smith 1997) and were named Cercozoa in 1998 (Cavalier-Smith 1998). The name is based on the cercomonads, amoeboflagellates that are abundant in soil and freshwater, which were first discovered by Dujardin (1841) the father of protozoology, who first realised that protozoa were cells. Even earlier Dujardin (1835) had discovered the reticulose testate cercozoan amoeba Gromia. Cercomonad means "tailed monad", because almost all cercomonads have an extensible pseudopodial tail that is typically drawn out along the posterior gliding cilium, sometimes obscuring it. Dujardin coined the name Rhizopoda (root feet) for organisms having filose or reticulose pseudopods. Unfortunately other authors later confusingly expanded that term to include also the unrelated Amoebozoa, which generally have broad lobose, non-root-like pseudopods. Cercozoa are now known to be one of the most diverse, speciose and ecologically important of all protozoan phyla and include the majority (not all) of eukaryotes with filose pseudopods or cilia that glide on surfaces instead of swimming (Cavalier-Smith and Chao 2003). Many lineages are currently known only from environmental DNA sequencing (Bass and Cavalier-Smith 2004; Bass et al. 2009), so cercozoan diversity must be even greater than is now appreciated.'

                      name: "Foraminifera"
                      desc: 'The Foraminifera, often called forams, are an ancient taxonomic group (sometimes considered a phylum, sometimes subphylum or class of Kingdom Rhizaria) of amoeboid, single-celled Eukaryotes.  They have a fossil record back to the earliest Cambrian, 570 million years ago.  Most Foraminifera live in benthic environments (ocean floors) although planktonic forams appeared in the fossil record starting about 170 million years ago and about 1% of known extant species live in the water column.  Foraminifera are traditionally considered marine organisms, indeed, in many marine environments they are the most abundant shelled organism.  Expert scientists estimate approximately 6000 described and about 1500 yet unknown marine foram species (Appeltans et al. 2012).  However, recent molecular studies challenge the idea that Foraminifera are almost entirely marine, through descriptions of multiple new foram groups representing multiple colonizations of freshwater environments (Holzmann et al. 2003), and new species that suggest diverse and abundant foraminiferan life in terrestrial soils (Lejzerowicz et al. 2010). Most forams have an external shell, the composition and shape of which is the primary determiner of foraminiferan taxonomy.  Because the organism"s protoplasm often covers it, the shell is referred to as a test.  Foram tests are composed of one of three different materials: secreted calcium carbonate or silica; secreted polysaccharides; or glued-together particles, such as quartz sand grains, sponge spicules, or other available building blocks that are the right size.  In most species the test is multi-chambered, and Foraminifera get their name from the tiny openings (foramina) between the chambers.  As they grow, Foraminifera build on more chambers, expanding to live in all of them except the one or two most recently built.  A broad diversity of chamber arrangement and many types and placements of aperture (the terminal opening to the outside of the test) define the test morphology, which can be quite beautiful and complex.  Some resembling mollusk and bivalve shells caused early taxonomists to believe foraminifera shared a lineage with the mollusks (Korsun et al. 2001; Olney 2002; Wetmore 1995). While most foraminiferan species have a maximum size between 0.05-0.7 mm, some species grow much larger.  One of the largest extant species, Cycloclypeus carpenteri, (Nummulitidae) measures over 10 cm across its disc-like test; another extant species, Syringammina fragilissima (Xenophyophorea) is documented up to 20 cm and looks like a porous beach ball made of sand.  The fossil record shows a diversity of even larger species.  Even the largest Foraminifera are single-celled, however they may have multiple nuclei (Krueger 1997; Pawlowski 2003; Song et al. 1994). Some of the largest species form symbiotic associations with algal cells.  Xenophyophoreans are thought to cultivate bacteria for food.  Other species are suspension feeders, opportunistic omnivores that eat detritus, smaller protists and even multicellular organisms from the substrate.  To reduce issues of high with surface area to volume ratios, forams have thin pseudopodia (called reticulopodia) which stretch out of tiny pores in the test, to dramatically extend their surface area.  Some stretch their long pseudopodia to form a large external feeding net, and they can also use their pseudopodia to burrow through the sediment or to attach themselves to rocks or plants efficiencies (Korsun et al. 2001; Olney 2002; Wetmore 1995). Foraminiferan species are found all over the world and species tend to be particular to their specific environment, for example, deep sea trenches, intertidal pools, coral reefs, brackish estuaries.  They can be extremely abundant, in some places in the deep sea the sediment on the sea floor is composed almost entirely of shells from planktonic species.  Forams are an important basic link in the marine food chain, as food for small invertebrates and fish.  Because they are so wide-spread and ancient in origin, fossil Foraminifera are useful for analyzing changes throughout time in ocean environments and temperatures and predicting climate changes.  They are used as bioindicators of the health of marine environments, including coral reefs.  The oil industry analyses forams deposits as they give precise indicators of age and conditions of rock formation important in guiding drilling for opimum oil well efficiencies (Korsun et al. 2001; Olney 2002; Smithsonian NMNH 2013; Wetmore 1995). A recent study compared Foraminiferan species diversity in deep sea environments (>1500m) around the world and found that species numbers, composition and genetic makeup was far more consistent among deep sea sampling locations than numbers and composition of foram species in different shallow habitats (<200 m), revealing greater stasis of species over space and time at depth.  Along with observations that deep sea species have a longer duration in the fossil record than do shallow species, they propose that a model where new species evolve in shallower areas and then migrating to deeper seas seems to be consistent with marine foram samplings (Buzas et al. 2013).'

In a few cells the hairs are absent and in one lineage they may be attached to the body surface. Cells may also be aflagellated, amoeboid, or mycelial, may be extremely large (some brown algal kelps). Cells may have scales, organic walls, or inorganic walls. Includes parasites, saprophytes, autotrophs, and heterotrophs; includes some taxa with great species diversity (e.g., diatoms). Ultrastructural identity: This group has considerable diversity, with few features common to all species. Mitochondria have tubular cristae, usually with two flagella but one group of lineages have a single flagellum, and another lineage has many flagella arranged in rows (kinetics). if two basal bodies are present, they are typically anchored by four microtubular roots. Plastids are present in many species, with three thylakoids per lamellae and with a stigma usually included within the plastid. Dictyosomes present. Extrusomes may be present or absent. Mitosis typically with fragmenting membrane and microtubules arising from external to the nucleus, most usually from the bases of the flagella. Synapomorphy: Tubulocristate protists with tripartite tubular hairs, but there has been secondary loss of this character in some subsets.'

                      desc: 'The diatoms are one of the largest and ecologically most significant groups of organisms on Earth. They are also one of the easiest to recognize, because of their unique cell structure, silicified cell wall and life cycle. They occur almost everywhere that is adequately lit (because most species need light for photosynthesis) and wet - in oceans, lakes and rivers; marshes, fens and bogs; damp moss and rock faces; even on the feathers of some diving birds. Some have been captured by other organisms and live as endosymbionts, e.g. in dinoflagellates and foraminifera. Because of their abundance in marine plankton, especially in nutrient-rich areas of the oceans, diatoms probably account for as much as 20% of global photosynthetic fixation of carbon (~ 20 Pg carbon fixed per year: Mann 1999), which is more than all the tropical rainforests. Diatom cells have regular geometrical shapes. In a mathematical sense, they are always "closed generalized cylinders" and they are usually straight ("right") but the cross section of the cylinder can vary from circular to elliptical to spicular to complex lobed shapes like the Hydrosera cell shown above. The shape is maintained faithfully, whatever the environmental conditions, because the cell wall contains a large proportion of hard, brittle silica, which is partially hydrated [(SiO2)m.nH2O] and non-crystalline. Basically, diatoms live in glass boxes. The silica shell of the diatom is called the "frustule" and is made of two halves, each in turn composed of several different pieces. Hydrosera frustules, like those of all other diatoms, are perforated by many small holes, which allow water, dissolved material and solids (gases, inorganic nutrients, and organic substrates and secretions) to pass in or out. The silica of the diatom cell wall is resistant to decay, although it will begin to dissolve once its organic coating has been stripped off. Once incorporated into silica-rich sediments, however, frustules may survive for hundreds to millions of years and can be used to monitor changes in freshwater or marine environments. The left-hand picture above shows a spread of living diatoms and other algae from a freshwater loch in Scotland. Each cell contains one to several brownish chloroplasts. Shown in the right-hand (false-colour) picture is a subfossil assemblage from a muddy deposit a few metres below the surface of a mire in SW Scotland. Here, all the cells are empty - only the cell walls remain; indeed, in many cases the cell walls have fallen apart into their component pieces. But it is still possible to identify them, because the walls retain their shape and pattern. Consequently, if the ecologies of the species are known, then the fossil assemblage can be used to estimate what conditions were like when it was formed. In the assemblage illustrated there are both planktonic species (the circular Cyclotella valves) and benthic species, which have become mixed together after death. Because of the construction of the silica frustule and the way in which cells divide, average cell size declines during the life cycles of most diatoms. The shape often changes too, as in the series of Navicula reinhardtii valves shown. It can take a long time for cells to decline to their smallest size - often several years in nature - but sooner or later there is an abrupt restitution of size, taking a few days, involving formation of a special cell, called an auxospore. This behaviour is unique. Variation in shape and size during the life cycle causes major problems for people trying to identify diatom species and also for taxonomists, if only a few dead specimens are available for study. If diatoms "miss" the chance to form auxospores (for example, if suitable mates are not available, or if environmental conditions are unsuitable), the cells continue to divide, getting smaller and smaller until they die.'

It is among the most prevalent single-celled intestinal parasites worldwide, but the clinical significance of its presence remains unclear, despite numerous studies to investigate its prevalence in different populations and its possible role in gastro- and extra-intestinal disease. There are some indications that the clinical significance of infection may depend on the genetic subtype of the infecting organisms. (Stensvold et al. 2009) The obligately anaerobic "Blastocystis hominis" was first described a century ago. Because it may take many different morphological forms in infected individuals, its taxonomic affiliations were uncertain for many years, but molecular systematic study has established that it belongs in the protist group known as the stramenopiles. Silberman et al. (1996) discussed the biological characteristics and phylogenetic placement of this protist. Because of the poorly understood genetic diversity of these parasites, many researchers now refer to Blastocystis or Blastocystis spp. rather than B. hominis (Santin et al. 2011). Tan (2004) reviewed the biology, epidemiology, and management of Blastocystis, but noted that its pathogenicity, its life cycle, and the function of certain of its organelles remained poorly understood, in part because of the lack of a suitable animal host model with which to pursue research on this parasite. Blastocystis infections have a worldwide distribution, but prevalence is highest in areas with poor hygiene and deficient sanitation services and facilities (Tan 2004).'

This places the mosses as the third most diverse group of land plants, only after the angiosperms and ferns. Mosses are small plants requiring stereoscopes and compound microscopes for routine examination. The conspicuous green leafy shoots are the gametophytes, haploid organisms, on which the diploid embryo develops into a mature sporophyte (Figure 1). The sporophyte is chlorophyllose and photosynthetic only in early stages of development, and it is mostly dependent on the gametophyte. Moss colonies are a very important element in many ecosystems, from the tundra to the tropical rain forest, reducing soil erosion, capturing water and nutrients, providing shelter for microfauna, and nurseries for seedlings in succession or regeneration processes. As a lineage, mosses are a historically crucial group in the understanding of the transition to life on land. The green leafy shoots (gametophytes) retain some features of the green algal ancestors (chlorophylls a and b, starch, sperm with two forward undulipodia), but the needle-like shoots that produce the spores (sporophytes) display key innovations for the life outside water, such as stomates, a simple strand of conductive cells [in an unbranched sporophyte], and airborne spores produced in a single apical capsule (sporangium). This is the simplest structural level among all land plants. The next organizational level is found in two fossil groups: Horneophythopsida and Aglaophyton (Rhynia) major, where the sporophyte is branched and produces several sporangia. The sporophyte shows the most complex structural organization in the tracheophytes.'

The exact relationship of cycads to other living gymnosperms based on molecular data remains controversial. Cycads superficially resemble palms or large ferns, but are not closely related to them. Based on the fossil record, cycads appeared in the Pennsylvanian, approximately 300 million years ago, and dominated the Mesozoic forests along with the conifers and Ginkgoales. Modern cycads, however, are largely confined to the tropics and subtropics of both the Old and New Worlds, with the genus Cycas having the widest distribution and extending as far north as Japan. Today many species (and even some genera) of cycads are facing extinction in the wild. The number of cycad species described gradually increased as exploration of cycad habitats spread, with seven species described by 1800, 33 by 1850, and 85 by 1900. The number of genera recognized also rose to six in 1850 and 10 by 1900. There are now thought to be around 300 species and between 10 and 12 genera in three to five families. One unusual feature of cycads is their development of specialized roots (known as coralloid roots) that are inhabited by nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc. As far as is known, cyanobacteria form symbiotic relationships with all cycads. Most, if not at all, cycads are insect pollinated. (Hill et al. 2003 and references therein; Chaw et al. 2005 and references therein) A rich and authoritative online resource with a wealth of information about cycads (including a list of key references and a page for each living cycad species with a description and information about geographic distribution, habitat, and conservation status) is The Cycad Pages. Another excellent resource is the website for the IUCN/SSC Cycad Specialist Group.'

Members of the magnoliid clade are widespread throughout tropical and temperate areas of the world and can be large trees, shrubs, vines, lianas, and occasionally herbs (Judd et al., 2002; D. Soltis et al., 2005). Economically important products derived from magnoliids include edible fruits, such as avocados (Persea americana) and guanabana, sour sop, cherimoya, and sweet sop (Annona spp.). Magnoliid species are also the source of spices (Judd et al., 2002; D. Soltis et al., 2005) such as black and white pepper (Piper nigrum), bay leaves (Laurus nigrus), nutmeg (Myristica fragrans), cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum), and camphor (Cinnamomum camphora). Other members are used as ornamentals or timber (e.g., Magnolia and Liriodendron; Judd et al., 2002; D. Soltis et al., 2005).'

Numerous vegetation types are dominated by monocots including grasslands, palm savannas, sedge meadows, and cattail marshes.'

The family is further characterized by scattered vascular bundles in the stems, and frequent presence of latex, usually with distinct, stellate-branched sclereids projecting into the air canals. Hairs are simple, usually producing mucilage (slime). Leaves are alternate and spiral, opposite or occasionally whorled, simple, peltate or nearly so, entire to toothed or dissected, short to long petiolate), with blade submerged, floating or emergent, with palmate to pinnate venation. Stipules are either present or absent. Flowers are solitary, bisexual, radial, with a long pedicel and usually floating or raised above the surface of the water, with girdling vascular bundles in receptacle. Sepals are 4-12, distinct to connate, imbricate, and often petal-like. Petals lacks or 8 to numerous, inconspicuous to showy, often intergrading with stamens. Stamens are 3 to numerous, the innermost sometimes represented by staminodes. Filaments are distinct, free or adnate to petaloid staminodes, slender and well differentiated from anthers to laminar and poorly differentiated from anthers; pollen grains usually monosulcate or lacking apertures. Carpels are 3 to numerous, distinct or connate. Fruit is an aggregate of nuts, a berry, or an irregularly dehiscent fleshy capsule. Seeds are often arillate, more or less lacking sperm.'

Trimastix however is in an interesting evolutionary position as the sister group to oxymonads, a moderately diverse and well-known group of animal commensals/symbionts (see Dacks et al., 2001; Hampl et al., 2009). Like oxymonads they are anaerobes/microaerophiles that lack classical mitochondria, and much of the current interest in Trimastix concerns the evolution of mitochondrial organelles in anaerobic eukaryotes (see Hampl et al., 2008).'

      desc: 'When first discovered in 1977, these microscopic single-celled organisms were classified as Bacteria. However, later genetic and biochemical analyses showed that they were more closely related to the Eukaryotes (which include humans). The researchers who discovered this, Woese and his colleagues, proposed the addition of the "domain" as a taxonomic level above that of kingdom, with all life classified within one of three domains, now called Bacteria, Eukaryotes, and Archaea. As of 2010 more than 250 species of Archaea had been described, most fitting into one of two groups, Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Many of these live in extreme environments - places where we once believed no life could exist.'
